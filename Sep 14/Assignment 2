Grade Evaluation: Write a C++ code snippet to check if a student's grade score is a passing grade (>= 60) or failing grade (< 60).

Number Comparison: Given three numbers a, b, and c, write a C++ expression to find the maximum of these three numbers.

Discount Eligibility: A customer is eligible for a discount if their purchase amount is greater than $100. Write a C++ code snippet to check if a purchase amount total qualifies for a discount.

Logical Operators
Eligibility Check: Determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on two conditions: age >= 18 and income >= 3000. Write a C++ expression to check eligibility.

Event Access: A person can attend an event if they have an invitation (hasInvitation) and are not underage (age >= 18). Write a C++ code snippet to determine if they can attend.

Safety Check: Check if a machine is operating safely. The machine is safe if the temperature is between 50 and 150 degrees and the pressure is below 200. Write a C++ expression to check if the machine is safe.

Course Enrollment: A student can enroll in a course if they meet either of these conditions: they are a senior or they have passed the prerequisites. Write a C++ expression to check enrollment eligibility.

Password Validation: Validate if a password is strong based on two conditions: length greater than 8 characters and contains at least one special character. Write a C++ code snippet to validate the password.

Bitwise Operators

Bitwise AND Operation: Perform a bitwise AND operation on the numbers 13 and 7. Write a C++ code snippet to show the result.

Bitwise OR Operation: Apply a bitwise OR operation between 10 and 5. Write a C++ code snippet to print the result.

Bitwise XOR Operation: Find the result of the bitwise XOR operation between 9 and 6. Write a C++ code snippet to output the result.

Bit Shifting: Shift the bits of the number 8 to the left by 2 positions. Write a C++ code snippet to show the resulting value.

Assignment Operators
Increment and Decrement: Given a variable counter initialized to 5, increment it by 3 and then decrement it by 2. Write a C++ code snippet to display the final value.

Expense Tracking: You have an initial amount of $200. You spend $50 and then receive $30 as a refund. Write a C++ code snippet to update and display the final amount.

Product Price Update: An item’s price is $25. Apply a 10% increase to the price using the += operator. Write a C++ code snippet to calculate and display the new price.

Savings Calculation: Calculate the total savings if you save $100 every month for 12 months. Use the *= operator to compute the savings and print the result.
